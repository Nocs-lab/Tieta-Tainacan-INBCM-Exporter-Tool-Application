The Museum Inventory Exporter plugin extends the Tainacan project by providing a custom exporter designed specifically for museum inventories. It allows administrators to export items from a single collection into a CSV file format, facilitating inventory management and archival processes, folloing the Brazilian IBRAM formats.

## Disclaimer

This plugin is specifically designed for use by Brazilian institutions and individuals who need to export data to meet the inventory requirements of the Brazilian Institute of Museums (Instituto Brasileiro de Museus - IBRAM). While the plugin may be useful in other contexts, its features and export formats are tailored to comply with IBRAM's guidelines and standards.

Please note that this plugin is still in beta. While we strive to ensure accuracy and compliance with IBRAM requirements, users should verify the exported data's conformity with current IBRAM standards before official submission. The developers of this plugin assume no responsibility for any discrepancies or non-compliance issues that may arise from the use of this tool in your inventory management processes.

Usage of this plugin outside of Brazil or for purposes other than exporting data for IBRAM inventory requirements is possible but not officially supported. Users are encouraged to review the plugin's documentation and source code to assess its suitability for other applications.

We welcome feedback and contributions from the community to improve the plugin and expand its capabilities. Please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section for more information on how you can help.
